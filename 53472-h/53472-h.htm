<h1>Myers’ Grand Hippodrome.</h1>

<h2>At the Crystal Palace.</h2>

<p>It is but natural that the greatest Hippodrome of
the world should be quartered at the greatest pleasure-resort
of the world, and the arrangements made at
the Crystal Palace for the reception and performances
of Mr. Myers’ Company will fittingly occupy the first
place in this brief account of his establishment, and
of the entertainments which will be offered to the
public during his visit to England. The stables
(marked D on plan), whose dimensions are given elsewhere,
occupy the basement at the north end of the
building adjoining the Skating Rink, and will be
open to the inspection of visitors, affording what is
really tantamount to a daily show of horses and ponies
of the highest breed, training, and mettle. The
arrangements for ventilation and the preservation of
cleanliness are perfect. The horses each occupy separate
stalls; the floor is of concrete, and the whole
is lighted with gas whenever necessary. The elephants
and camels are housed in specially-erected stables
(E on plan) at the north end of the Second Terrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
near the bear-pit; and the lions are caged on the
north lawns, being transported daily with their cages
to the various places of exhibition.</p>

<p>The performances take place in various <i lang="fr">locales</i>&mdash;in
fact it may safely be affirmed that no arena in
England could be found better adapted than the Crystal
Palace for the display of Mr. Myers’ resources. The
great course of three-quarters of a mile in length
(C on plan) has been formed by connecting the First
and Second Terraces, on which will take place the
steeple-chases, hurdle-races, parades of richly-mounted
carriages lavishly plated and decorated, and revivals
of classic sports. This transformation has been
effected by the construction of two inclined planes,
120 yards in length, built of timber, supported on
piles, and overlaid with a thick stratum of earth or
tan to form a suitable roadway.</p>

<p>The conformation of the Greek hippodrome was
not unlike that of the great course formed in the
Crystal Palace grounds, the sides being parallel, and
one end semicircular. The site for the hippodrome
of old was also chosen, as a rule, on the side of a hill.
The circuit of the Olympic hippodrome was about 2,500
feet, or a little less than half a mile; that of the course
on the first and second terraces of the Crystal Palace is
3,760 feet, or half as long again. The width of the
Greek hippodrome was about 400 feet; that of the
Crystal Palace also 400 feet. The Circus Maximus of
Rome was three stadia, or about 1,800 feet, in length;
and about 600 feet across.</p>

<p>If we picture to ourselves the whole frontage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the Crystal Palace, 1,584 feet in length, tier
upon tier affording accommodation to thousands of
spectators, and overlooking a combination of natural
and artificial scenery such as is hardly to be matched
in England, we may justly claim that the Coliseum
of Rome in all its glory did not afford a spectacle
so picturesque, and with the additional advantage that
the performances at the Crystal Palace will be entirely
free from debasing elements.</p>

<p>The equestrian performances, entertainments of
Oriental jugglery and acrobats, feats of lion-taming,
by John Cooper, and other exhibitions, are divided
between the great centre transept (A on plan) and the
great waterproof tent (B on plan) erected at the
north end, occupying 21,600 square feet, and capable
of holding 4,000 persons. An ingenious plan has been
devised by which the centre transept can be at will
transformed into an enormous circus, or revert to its
normal use as a promenade, a theatre, or colossal
concert-hall. A ring of 44 feet outer and 30 feet inner
dimensions, has been formed by constructing a sunken
circle about 12 inches below the level of the original
floor, which is rendered capable of removal to just
such an extent as will disclose the ring, the boarding
being replaced to form the ordinary promenade, at
such times as the circus performances are not going
on. The elephants and other animals will be brought
from their stables in the basement and park to the
centre transept along an inclined plane of about 250
feet in length, and of ample width to allow both human
and quadrupedal performers to pass or repass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h2>Magnitude of Mr. Myers’ Establishment.</h2>

<p>The magnitude of Mr. Myers’ establishment may
be, in some degree, estimated when we state that its
performances employ no less than 200 persons&mdash;as equestrians,
acrobats, clowns, musicians, children, &amp;c., and
200 performing animals, comprising 132 horses, 18
ponies, 9 elephants, 7 lions, 6 camels, besides monkeys,
dogs, and mules. The estimated value of <i lang="fr">matériel</i>
alone is £150,000, and the daily expenses are over
£250. Another idea of its extent may be gained
from a few facts as to its transport to England, which
required a train of no less than 46 waggons, besides
passenger carriages, for the conveyance from Paris
to Boulogne, where it was transferred to the two
steam-vessels <i>Leo</i> and <i>Rhine</i>, which were specially
detached from the General Steam Navigation Company’s
Continental service, for the voyage to
London. The area of the stabling and harness-rooms
at the Crystal Palace is no less than 27,456 square
feet; and the dressing-rooms alone occupy 3,472
square feet. The elephants, horses, and camels require
about 10,000 pounds of corn, 8,000 pounds of hay,
8,000 pounds of straw, 2,000 pounds of bran, and
3,000 pounds of potatoes per week; while the lions
consume 400 pounds of beef per week.</p>

<h2>Career of Mr. Myers.</h2>

<p>Mr. J. W. Myers, the proprietor of the largest Hippodrome
in the world, was born in New York in 1828.
Though still in the prime of life, he is a veteran in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
profession, having commenced his public career at the
early age of nine by apprenticing himself as an equestrian
to Aaron Turner and Sons, partners of the celebrated
Barnum. <i lang="la">Ex nihilo nihil fit</i>, and Mr. Myers thus early
recognised the truth of the proverb by taking care to
be provided with the small though substantial capital
of one halfpenny, with which, as the nucleus of fortune,
he fled from his home. He made rapid progress in his
calling, and soon distinguished himself as being the first
who ever did a double somersault over horses. A
few years’ experience placed him foremost among
equestrians, and at the age of twenty-one he started
a Circus and Menagerie of his own, with which he
travelled over the United States for seven years. He
then sold his property to Mr. John Wilson (whose
establishment was at the time the largest of its kind in
America) and came to England, having, shortly after
his arrival, the distinguished honour of performing
before Her Majesty the Queen and the late Prince
Consort, at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers was for seventeen months engaged with
Messrs. Howes and Cushing, and at the expiration of
that time he again formed a company of his own, and
performed with great success at Birmingham and other
English towns. Leaving England for the Continent
he commenced the career which has culminated in
the formation of an establishment of unprecedented
magnitude.</p>

<p>The Mecca of Mr. Myers’ long pilgrimage was, of
course, Paris; and a Paris journal gives a characteristic
account of the interview in which the <i lang="fr">entrepreneur</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
acquired possession of the Magasins Réunis, which he
has transformed into the vast establishment which has
been the sensation of the capital of the world of pleasure
during the last six months. The Paris <cite>Figaro</cite> states
that on a certain day in last autumn the proprietor of
the Magasins Réunis, Baron E&mdash;&mdash;, was visited by a
stranger who expressed his desire to hire the structure,
till then a drug in the market. Baron E&mdash;&mdash; was
startled for a moment, but, soon recovering his self-possession,
replied that he was willing to let, but only
on a twenty years’ lease. “Be it so,” answered the
applicant. The owner believed himself the sport of a
dream, and could only feebly articulate “75,000 francs
(£3,000) a year.” “I’ll give you 75,000 francs a year,”
answered the visitor, “and here’s a year’s rent in
advance.” The bargain was struck, and the applicant
announced himself as Mr. J. W. Myers, the proprietor
of a peripatetic hippodrome. Mr. Myers set himself
with all possible speed to adapt his new acquisition to
his purposes, and the great range of warehouses at the
Château d’Eau was in a very few weeks transformed, at
an outlay of not less than a million of francs, into a place
of entertainment which has been one of the wonders of
Paris since December 19, 1875, when it was first opened
to the public. The great circus into which the central
court was converted accommodates an audience of more
than 8,000 persons, and the establishment is described
by <cite>La France</cite> as a complete world in itself. In fact,
the Paris press is singularly unanimous in pronouncing
it to be not only the greatest hippodrome which has
ever visited Paris, but (what is perhaps synonymous)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the greatest in the world, unparalleled in grandeur
and magnificence.</p>

<p>For the Hippodrome of Mr. Myers has attained
its present unequalled proportions by gradual and steady
growth. There is an eclecticism even in Circus business,
and Mr. Myers has excelled the doings of his predecessors
and contemporaries, not merely by employing nine
elephants where they used to employ <em>one</em> performer and
three or four “dummies”; by doubling the usual number
of the band, of the horses, and other component parts of
such an establishment: but he has taken care that his
horses shall be the best bred; that his elephants shall
be the most highly trained; that his equestrians shall be
the most finished and daring; that his clowns shall be
the most amusing; that his acrobats shall be the most
graceful that have ever been seen in public. If the patronage
of the great ones of the earth be a test of merit,
Mr. Myers may claim to possess that merit in a supereminent
degree. The Emperor William of Germany,
the Empress Augusta, the Emperor Francis Joseph
and the Empress of Austria, King Victor Emmanuel
of Italy, King Alfonso of Spain, the King and Queen
of the Belgians, the King and Queen of the Netherlands,
the King and Queen of Saxony, the Queen of Greece,
the Khedive of Egypt, the President of Switzerland,
the late Emperor Napoleon III., the Empress Eugenie,
the ex-Queen Isabella of Spain, the King and Queen
of Hanover, and the unfortunate Abdul Aziz of Turkey,
have all, at various times and places, honoured Mr.
Myers with their presence at his performances. Lyons,
Bordeaux, Toulon, Dijon, Nimes, St. Étienne, Nice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Grenoble, Avignon, Toulouse, and all the great towns
in France; Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfort, Breslau,
Dresden, Königsberg, Leipsic, Cologne, Mayence,
Vienna, Nuremberg, Munich, Bremen, Dantzic, Stettin,
Regensburg, Strasburg, Metz, in Germany; Rome,
Turin, Milan, Florence, Genoa, Verona, Venice, Padua,
in Italy; Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, Utrecht,
in Holland; Brussels, and other towns in Belgium;
Berne, Aarau, Schaffhausen, Zurich, Lausanne, Geneva,
Zug, Basle, St. Gallen, in Switzerland, have all been
visited by Mr. Myers; and the press of these places
has been unanimous in its laudatory notices of his
establishment and its performances.</p>

<h2>Animal Performances in Ancient Times.</h2>

<p>The love for spectacles in which animals take part is
inherent in human nature, and directed the current of
popular amusements at a very early period of the world’s
history. There is a natural pleasure in witnessing performances
which illustrate the sovereignty which man’s
intellect enables him to obtain over the largest and
fiercest of the brutes. Some of the most beautiful of
the classic myths are based on this dominion of man
over the animal creation. The Centaurs were but
early trainers and riders of horses, the vulgar imagination
amalgamating the horse and its rider into one
strange creature whose beneficent deeds rendered him
worthy of deification. The chariot race is described by
Homer as the most important item in the series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
funeral games in honour of Patroclus. Chariot-racing
was introduced at the 25th Olympiad (about <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 680),
and racing by single horses in the 33rd Olympiad
(about <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 648). Elephants were first introduced
in the Roman circus in the year <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 251, when Lucius
Metellus exhibited them as part of the spoil of his
victory over the Carthaginians. Lions and panthers
were first exhibited in <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 186 by M. Fulvius, after
the Ætolian war. After this date wild beasts became
a regular feature of the Roman entertainments.
Scaurus, in <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 58, exhibited a hippopotamus and five
crocodiles. Julius Cæsar introduced giraffes into Italy
for the first time in <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 45; Augustus, a rhinoceros in
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 29. But these animals were used mainly for the
<i lang="la">venatio</i>, or exhibition in which they fought against each
other, or against man&mdash;the contrast between the old
Circensian games and the modern performances being
all in favour of our own times as regards humanity.</p>

<h2>The Performing Elephants.</h2>

<p>Elephants have, from a very early period in the history
of circus entertainments, played a leading part in
the performances. They were, in fact, the first animals
(except, of course, horses) introduced into the ancient
amphitheatre, Lucius Metellus having (as stated
above) paraded them as part of the spoils of the
Carthaginian war. In the time of Pompey’s rule at
Rome there was an attempt on the part of the elephants
to break down the barriers which separated them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the public, an act of insubordination which led Cæsar to
alter the form of the circus. We hear of elephants as
rope-walkers in the time of Galba and Nero, and, in the
reign of the latter emperor, an elephant mounted an
arch and thence walked on a rope with a man on his
back. Pliny, in his “Natural History,” has an account
of an exhibition given by Germanicus, in which elephants
walked the tight-rope, fought with javelins, and
executed the Pyrrhic dance; and Seneca, Suetonius,
Dion Cassius, and Œlian bear testimony to their talents
and high training. Pliny says that the elephant is able
to walk up the rope backwards, and down it head foremost.
Elephants are peculiarly susceptible to the influence
of music, and the Romans took full advantage of
this susceptibility. They were trained to march into
the amphitheatre to the rhythm of musical instruments;
and we have in Arrian an account of an elephant who,
with cymbals fastened to his knees and trunk, beat time
to which his comrades danced. They also took part in
mimic representations of a banquet, reclining at which,
in suitable costume of ladies and gentlemen of the
period, they behaved very much like those they represented,
eating and drinking with due decorum.
Elephant performances have been a feature of modern
hippodromes, but it was reserved for Mr. Myers’
coadjutor, John Cooper, to rediscover the lost art
of elephant training and performing, as understood
by the ancients. Music has played an important
part in the education of Mr. Myers’ <i lang="fr">troupe</i> of
elephants. They waltz with pachydermatous grace,
and in perfect time; they execute complete ballets with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
an accuracy and confident knowledge of their respective
<i lang="fr">rôles</i>, which many a human performer might envy.
They perform dramatic scenes with a perfect appreciation
of the situation. An anecdote or two will illustrate
their intelligence. It is recorded that, while performing
in a certain town, the <i lang="fr">troupe</i> had each evening, while
on the road from the stables to the place of representation,
to pass in front of the tap of a brewery. One day,
as they were <i lang="fr">en route</i>, one of the drinkers held out his
glass of beer to an elephant. The elephant gracefully
accepted the compliment, took with the utmost delicacy
the glass from the hand of the donor, poured the
contents down its throat, and politely returned the
empty vessel to its owner. The bystanders were so
amused, that in an instant a crowd of glasses was tendered
to the crowd of trunks, and the same ceremony
was performed by all the elephants present. The proprietor
of the establishment, in an excess of generosity,
brought out a barrel of beer, which was soon emptied
by the combined efforts of the trunks, and the <i lang="fr">troupe</i>
went on its way rejoicing to its duties. But the
next evening the elephants, to the surprise of their
keepers, unanimously refused the ordinary beverage
which was provided before starting to their tasks.
They were not pressed, and the <i lang="fr">cortége</i> took its
way to the theatre; but, on arriving in front of the
brewery, the elephants, to the consternation of their
guides, refused to budge a step until the performance
of the preceding day had been repeated. The
brewer, with less satisfaction than on the preceding
evening, provided a second barrel of beer, and begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the superintendent of the procession to take another
road for the future. But he had reckoned without his
host. In spite of all the efforts of the keepers, at the
same hour the next evening an array of trunks was
again extended in front of the brewery, and a third
barrel went the way of its predecessors. In despair the
brewer related his sad case to Mr. Myers, who indemnified
him, ordered a barrel of beer to be delivered at each
passage of the <i lang="fr">troupe</i>, and, it is said, has ever since,
when travelling, taken care that his elephants shall
avoid all streets in which stands temptation in the
shape of a brewery. Another story is told of one of the
sagacious animals whose keeper, returning fatigued at
night, fell asleep on a truss of straw, and was uplifted
by the trunk of his faithful four-footed valet, and placed
in a manger; the elephant not contenting himself with
this delicate attention, but proceeding to take off the
boots of the sleeper, and cover him carefully with two
or three trusses of straw!</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of Mr. Myers’ exhibitions,
is the bathing and swimming of the elephants, which
takes place in the lakes of the Crystal Palace. The
sight is a most amusing one; in fact, one day’s casual
bathe of the elephants in the Rhine, when Mr. Myers
was at Cologne, so excited the curiosity of the townspeople,
that a guarantee of some thousands of thalers
was raised to ensure its repetition on successive days.
The great beasts play hide-and-seek with each other,
and, with their keepers, they turn somersaults in the
water; they are as uncontrollable and spontaneous in
their mirth as a pack of boys turned loose into a playground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
after school hours with <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to amuse
themselves. Indeed the only drawback to their being
allowed to enter the water is the difficulty of getting them
back for their more serious duties. Pursuit with boats
is attendant with the risk of the sudden elevation of the
vessel and its occupants some ten or twenty feet into
the air; and even when one is captured and seemingly
brought to a sense of its duties, the temptation to rejoin
its sporting comrades is too strong for it, and if unwatched
for an instant, it takes the opportunity of
plunging in again. Nothing but the firm though mild
rule of John Cooper then avails to bring them up to the
time and place for their other performances.</p>

<h2>John Cooper and Lion Taming.</h2>

<p>With the lions of Mr. Myers’ Hippodrome the name
of John Cooper is inseparably associated. This foremost
animal trainer in the world, was born at Birmingham
in 1838, and entered upon his present career under
the auspices of George Batty (brother of the Batty of
hippodromatic fame of 1851), who was then travelling
on the Continent with his circus and menagerie.
Cooper commenced lion-taming at the early age of
twelve, and has followed the profession of trainer of
wild animals without cessation till the present time.
He remained with George Batty about fifteen years,
and at the expiration of that time bought some lions,
and started on his own account. In 1866-67 he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Mr. Myers, who ultimately bought Cooper’s lions, and
engaged the services of their owner at a salary unprecedented
in the profession. The secret of Cooper’s
success is his love of animals, allied with a temperament
in which fear is no element, and a calm sense of
superiority which is felt by his brute servants no less
than by himself.</p>

<p>Some remarkable instances of his immediate ascendency
over the fiercest animals are on record. When
Lucas, the lion-tamer, was killed by his own lions, he
left a wife and child with no other resource than the
ownership of the fierce brutes. M. Arnauld, manager
of the hippodrome where the tragedy took place, gave
a benefit performance for the widow, and Cooper volunteered
to enter the cage of the lions, whom he had never
before seen, and who had never before seen him, and to
perform with them, a task which he accomplished to
the astonishment of all beholders. Victor Emmanuel of
Italy&mdash;one who, like Cooper, never quailed before danger&mdash;found
a kindred spirit in the lion-tamer, and has
honoured him with special marks of approbation; one
of his presents being two splendid lions, which form
part of the <i lang="fr">troupe</i> with which Cooper performs. Four
camels and an elephant are also gifts of the soldier-king.
John Cooper has trained, while with Mr. Myers,
42 lions, 16 elephants, 25 camels, besides monkeys,
bears, hyænas, and other animals. It is a popular fallacy
that trainers of such animals begin their task while
their pupils are in infancy. Cooper does not commence
with lions till they are five years old; only in one case,
that of the King of Italy’s lions, did he begin at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
four-and-a-half years. Whatever and however fierce
the animals presented, he enters their cage without
hesitation and without emotion, at the first interview.
In the presence of his ferocious <i lang="fr">protégés</i> a remarkable
change takes place in the demeanour of Cooper, and it
is difficult to realise that the quiet, mild, and gentle
individual with whom one has been recently conversing
is the same person with the stern, energetic, and commanding
figure, with the bright and penetrating eyes,
before which quail the fiercest of the beasts, and whose
iron will renders them compliant with his every nod
and beck.</p>

<p>We have before alluded to Cooper’s fondness for
animals. One incident is worth recording, as illustrating
both that trait and his dauntless intrepidity.
While the lions were one day engaged in their performances,
springing over the head of their master,
bounding from one side of the cage to the other, a
favourite lioness failed to clear the movable barrier
which the trainer uses to separate the animals when
necessary, or, as in the present instance, as a kind of
hurdle over which they are to leap in traversing the
cage. The impulse of the spring forced apart the iron
bars of the barrier, and the head and fore-part of the
poor lioness were fixed as in a vice, at the height of
some feet from the floor of the cage. The situation
was somewhat critical, as Cooper had around him the
other lions, which were evidently excited by the fix
of their companion; but, nothing daunted, he attempted
to release the prisoner by manual force. She was,
however, too firmly fixed; and Cooper called for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mallet, a lever, and other tools, with which, unheeding
his ferocious and excited attendants&mdash;against whom
he for the time had no defence&mdash;he separated or
broke the bars, and released the lioness from her
painful position.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers relates an account of a desperate fight
between a Senegal and Nubian lion, which, in the
absence of Cooper, he and his people vainly tried to
stop by red-hot iron bars, by throwing several pounds
of snuff into their eyes, and other unsuccessful means.
The fight resulted in the death of the larger lion before
Cooper could arrive to separate the furious beasts;
but, on his arrival, he at once entered the cage, severely
chastised the victor, and attaching ropes to the body
of the dead lion, dragged it out of the cage without
molestation.</p>

<p>Mr. Myers’ experience of a quarter of a century
with lions tells him that, contrary to popular belief,
lions born in captivity are less intelligent and much
more fierce and nimble than those born in a state of
liberty. The victor in the above-related fight was born
in captivity. But whether born in the great forests of
the tropics or the narrow cages of the travelling
menagerie, all fierce animals are alike cowed by the
magnetic power of John Cooper, and Mr. Myers’ longstanding
challenge of £100,000 to be awarded to any
lion-tamer in the world who will perform the same feats
as John Cooper is still unaccepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2>Equestrian Scenes.</h2>

<p>With such an unrivalled stud as that of Mr. Myers,
and with such a company of equestrians, it is, of
course, inevitable that the scenes of the circle will be
on a commensurate scale. Mr. Myers has enlisted the
services of almost all the best-known riders, and his
horses fulfil all the requirements of the circle, both
for high breed, for docility, and for training. There
is not a more accomplished and graceful horsewoman
in the world than Mrs. Myers; and her performance
on her thoroughbred steed “Cromwell” will form one
of the most pleasing features of the exhibition.
Madame Nyegaard’s feats, performed while riding a
barebacked steed, are also unique; while the Madigans
are unsurpassed in those daring gymnastic feats which
would almost lead one to the belief that the rider
was born and brought up on horseback, that he lives,
takes his meals, and sleeps on horseback, and that a
visit to <i lang="la">terra firma</i> is an abnormal occurrence which
occasionally breaks the monotony of his ordinary life.</p>

<p>James Madigan’s double somersaults, performed
while the horse is at full speed, and Charles Madigan’s
riding of four trained horses at once, are feats which
have excited the admiration of all the towns on the
Continent which Mr. Myers’ Hippodrome has visited.
Special attention must also be drawn to the quadrille of
eight thoroughbreds ridden by four ladies and four
gentlemen, all accomplished performers, who guide
their intelligent steeds with the utmost grace and
dexterity through the most intricate figures of the dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the most notable of Mr. Myers’ horses are
the thoroughbred “Cromwell,” mentioned above; the
horse “Mexican,” presented to Mr. Myers by the ill-fated
Emperor Maximilian; and the seven coal-black
horses from the Imperial stables of Trakhene, in
Prussia.</p>

<h2>Parades and Processions, Sports, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>One of the features of the performances in the
Roman Circus Maximus was the grand procession
which preceded the sports, and in which all who were
about to exhibit took part. These will be reproduced
during the stay of Mr. Myers’ establishment at the
Crystal Palace; the chariots, constructed on the classic
model, gorgeously decorated and lavishly plated, and
drawn by horses of the highest breed and mettle, being
daily paraded on the great course constructed on the
First and Second Terraces, as before described. There
also will take place from time to time the hurdle-races,
steeple-chases, and other entertainments, in which the
great resources of Mr. Myers will be utilised. The
classical character of this portion of the entertainment
will be maintained by the decorations, which have
been entrusted to Mr. Fenton, and in which, amongst
other items, the fasces and ova, which formed important
features in a Roman circus, will be reproduced.</p>

<h2>Acrobatic and other Entertainments.</h2>

<p>The miscellaneous entertainments given by Mr.
Myers are of great variety; in fact, he is able with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
perfect ease to change his programme daily, such are
his resources. An attractive item is the performance
of the Japanese <i lang="fr">troupe</i>, brought from Japan expressly
for Mr. Myers, and in which the brothers Moto and
Assa exhibit a flexibility which implies the possession
of spines of abnormal elasticity; while Gingero and
Como-Ketchy go through a series of balancing feats
which cast into the shade all contemporary performances
of a like nature. Especially wonderful is the business
with the bamboo ladder, up and down which, while it
is supported on the chest of one of the performers, the
other runs with the greatest rapidity, standing on his
head on the top, creeping in and out between the
rounds; and which at last, at a given signal, falls to
pieces, leaving only one side-piece, with the acrobat
standing on the top. A band of Bedouin Arabs also
appears in those bounding feats which seem the
speciality of the sons of the Desert. Miss Charlotte
Felix’s <i lang="fr">troupe</i> of performing dogs go through a series of
interesting tricks, which illustrate to what a pitch of
perfection of training these sagacious animals can be
brought; and a number of clowns, headed by the well-known
Hulines, add zest to the interludes by their
quaint sayings and grotesque tricks.</p>

<h2>The Equestrian Pantomime, Little Red Riding
Hood.</h2>

<p>The latest addition to the varied attractions of Mr.
Myers’ establishment has been a gorgeous spectacular
pantomime on the subject of Little Red Riding Hood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
(Le Petit Chaperon Rouge), which was produced in
Paris in April last, at a preliminary outlay of 120,000
francs, and which forms one of the most striking
features of the Crystal Palace performances. The
charming little story of Perrault has been ingeniously
adapted to the equestrian resources of Mr. Myers’
hippodrome. The pantomime opens with a pretty
ballet, in which the fairy Good Heart and her attendant
fays take part. Little Red Riding Hood next
appears, with her basket, and is surprised by the wolf,
but is for the time being saved from danger by the
appearance of a host of little hunters, whose horns
terrify the savage beast, and who chase him on their
tiny ponies till they unfortunately lose his track. The
wolf then slays and devours the grandmother, and disguises
himself in her dress to deceive more effectually
his intended victim; but she is saved, of course, by the
entrance of the young prince, who captures the wolf,
and encloses him with some trouble in a great cage. A
grand <i lang="fr">bal champêtre</i> follows, given by the fairy Good
Heart in honour of Little Red Riding Hood. The circus
is transformed into a garden, with copses, alleys, flowers,
tended by little gardeners. Little Red Riding Hood,
transformed by the fairy into a princess, appears;
guests of all nations, and all classes of society, arrive,
in appropriate dresses.</p>

<p>Distinguished Orientals, comprising the Shah of
Persia and Chinese and Japanese ambassadors, are
intermingled with dukes and duchesses, marquises
and marchionesses, of the Western world. Waltzes,
quadrilles, and galops are the order of the day. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
skipping-rope dance by Little Red Riding Hood succeeds, in
which time is kept to the music with wonderful precision
and exquisite grace. Now appear the gala
chariots, to convey away the prince and princess.
A procession of miniature chariots, richly gilded, each
bearing two footmen, sumptuously dressed and heavily
powdered, are drawn in, each by six Lilliputian horses
with lavishly plated harness, and conducted by little
coachmen. The arrival of the great allegorical chariot,
drawn by six magnificent horses, all arrayed in dazzling
silver-plated harness, and bearing the colours of various
nations, forms a suitable finale to a spectacle which
consists of a series of tableaux of more than an hour’s
duration, which have never been surpassed in originality
and richness, and which will surely be more effective in
the Crystal Palace than it was in the great court of the
Magasins Réunis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This little book aims merely at giving a
short account of the rise, progress, and magnitude of
Mr. Myers’ Great Hippodrome, and a brief abstract of
the entertainments which will <em>at various times</em> be offered
to the public during his visit. It will be readily understood
from its contents, that his resources are so vast,
that it would be utterly impracticable to use more than
a portion on one day, and that the programme will from
time to time be selected from the items of which the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
